# clipboardOCR
Take an image of text from clipboard, OCR it, show result and allow to copy the text to clipboard.
For example, select some part of a scanned pdf page, copy it to clipboard and than run the script. OCR-ed result will be shown in a dedicated window. Then it can be copied to clipboard for further use. 
The project uses several third party applications:
1. Tesseract and pytesseract which do the OCR magic. Information can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/
2. Pillow which does the magic of image manipulation. Information can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/

Enjoy.
