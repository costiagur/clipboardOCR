# clipboardOCR
Take an image of text from clipboard, click OCRit button and get the text, as detected by Tesseract OCR.
Note that tesseract is not included, and should be unpacked and places in a sub folder called "tesseract", which should be placed in the same folder where all the other application files are located. 
The project uses several third party applications:
1. Tesseract and pytesseract - https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/
2. Pillow - https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/

Enjoy.
